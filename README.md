# Moving-Ball-Optimization-Project-using-inline-Assembly

Project Goal: The goal of this project was to spot optimize sections of the game loop using DarkGDK development kit and C++ in visual studio to decrease input bottleneck  using inline assembly for the 1st time.

What is the value of this project? All types of code are translated into Assembly language before they are executed by the cpu. In today's age of programming only 5% of today's programmers even know what Assembly Language is and even less can use it in today's age of programming for special programming tasks and for spot optimizations using inline assembly so having these concepts down puts you in rare case of skills and concepts most developers don't have especially in optimizing for performance.


What did I learn that was valuable? I now know how to optimize in C++ using inline assembly, have a deep understanding of CPU register architectures, and a good understanding of assembly compilers such as Masm and x86emulator. I also have solid coding optimization knowledge for execution performance.
